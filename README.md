Bin2Bite
Bin2Bite is an initiative that helps in reducing food wastage by connecting people with excess food to those in need. By fetching your live location, it provides a list of nearby food donors, allowing you to connect and procure the food. The project also includes a radius filter that helps you filter donors based on your live location, making it easier to access food that would otherwise go to waste.

Features
Live Location Access: Fetches and uses your live location to show nearby food donors.

Radius Filter: Customize the search radius to find donors within a specific distance from your location.

Donor Connections: Connect directly with donors to procure excess food.

Sustainable Food Sharing: Aims to reduce food wastage by promoting food sharing in the community.
