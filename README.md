# Bin2Bite

Bin2Bite is a community-driven initiative that aims to reduce food wastage by connecting individuals with excess food to those in need. The platform uses your live location to display nearby food donors, making it easier for you to connect and procure surplus food. Additionally, a customizable radius filter allows you to adjust the search distance based on your location.

## Features

- **Live Location Access**:  
  The application fetches your live location to identify and display nearby food donors in real-time.

- **Radius Filter**:  
  Customize the search radius to find donors within a specific distance from your location, ensuring you only see relevant results.

- **Donor Connections**:  
  Connect directly with food donors to arrange the collection of excess food, reducing waste and promoting sustainability.

- **Sustainable Food Sharing**:  
  By connecting individuals with surplus food to those in need, Bin2Bite helps create a more sustainable food-sharing community.
